This project is an end-to-end analysis of student results using Python and various data analysis libraries. The purpose of this project is to provide insights into student performance based on the provided dataset.
The dataset used in this project contains information about student performance including attributes such as gender, marks in different subjects,parent's education,parent's marital status etc. It is provided in CSV format (student_scores.csv) and is included in the repository.

Features:
Data Cleaning: The project involves cleaning the dataset to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of various variables and relationships between them.

Data Visualization: Utilizing visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data for better understanding.

Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical analysis to derive insights and patterns from the dataset.

Predictive Modeling: Building predictive models to forecast student performance or identify factors affecting student outcomes.
